<h1> <strong> STAR WARS GALAGA! </strong> </h1> <br>
On this page is a recreation of the classic game Galaga. Here you will find a background of what this game is and how it was created as well videos explaining how the code works and lastly there will be directions for the game itself so you can play it yourself! <br>
<br> In this recreation, me and my partner Guillermo have made models for things such as TIE fighters and X-Wing fighters from the movie Star Wars. We made this recreation in the programming window of Khan Academy which our class for URI has used as its workspace throughout this semester and it has done an amazing job at teaching us the basics of computer programming. I am a computer science major so this has been a great start for someone who will learn many other languages in the future. If you are interested, below are two YouTube videos that showcase the code and the Khan Academy workspace we used. We also give an in depth look at what all the code means and what each individual thing does. Please feel free to check that out! Being able to create such a classic game and adding our own spin to it has been so much fun and we really let our imagination run wild. We hope you like it! <br>
Below this are the directions to the game if you wish to play it. Be sure to have fun but most importantly... <br>
<br> <strong> May the force be with you...  </strong> <br> <br>
