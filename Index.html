        <h1>Welcome To <strong>Matt's</strong> Portfolio Page!</h1>
        <strong>My name is <em>Matthew Bolduc</em>, I am a freshman at URI. <br>
        I am majoring in computer science and I really enjoy technology and I find things such as robots and other devices really cool! 
        I hope to work for a big company one day to help make the world a better place! I enjoy the rush of programming and the rewarding feeling 
        it provides. I hope to become a great programmer and continue to enhance our everyday technology. Soon I hope that simple, monotonous
        tasks will be done by robots so that the more complicated jobs can be focused on by humans. <br>
        <br>
        Although this page is small now, I hope to have it absolutely packed with amazing projects that I learn throughout my time in college
        as well as things I learn in my free time. Although I am new to all of this, I think it is really fasciniating and I cannot wait until
        I can produce massive projects that look stunning and serve a purpose.</strong>
